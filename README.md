DIY Portable Donkey Kong Bongos - Play Them Anywhere

Here is the code I made to enable me to use my Donkey Kong Bongos anywhere, playing any sound on each button I choose.
It's a little messy, but it works, as all good code should. The clap sensor on the Bongos work by sending the strength of how hard R is being held.

Ty for your libraries.
